# Test Coverage Compliance Analysis

**Date**: 2025-12-07  
**Analysis Type**: Comprehensive test coverage and compliance verification

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Status: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY COMPLIANT**

- **Overall Coverage**: 71.7% ✅ (exceeds 60% minimum threshold)
- **Core Package Coverage**: 74.2% ❌ (below 80% required threshold)
- **Test Failures**: 4 tests failing (blocking compliance)
- **Missing Test Files**: 2 test files referenced but missing

---

## Coverage Metrics

### Overall Coverage

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Overall Coverage** | 71.7% | ≥ 60% | ✅ **PASS** |
| **Critical Threshold** | 71.7% | ≥ 50% | ✅ **PASS** |

### Core Package Coverage

Core packages (`pkg/config` and `internal/core`) have a **higher coverage requirement of 80%**.

| Package | Coverage | Threshold | Status |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------|
| `pkg/config` | 66.7% | ≥ 80% | ❌ **FAIL** |
| `internal/core` | 83.9% | ≥ 80% | ✅ **PASS** |
| **Combined Average** | **74.2%** | **≥ 80%** | ❌ **FAIL** |

**Issue**: `pkg/config` package is significantly below the 80% threshold, pulling down the combined average.

## Test Failures

### Critical Failures (Blocking Compliance)

#### 1. `internal/tools/cliintrospect` - 2 Test Failures

**Failing Tests:**
- `TestIntrospect_WithSubcommands`: Expected 2 subcommands, got 0
- `TestFlagToInfo_BoolFlag`: Expected persistent to be true

**Impact**: CLI introspection tool tests are failing, indicating potential issues with command structure detection.

**Status**: ❌ **BLOCKING**

#### 2. `internal/cli/commands` - 2 Test Failures

**Failing Tests:**
- `TestBuildInvalidEnvFails`: Expected invalid environment error, got config not found
- `TestBuildExplicitVersionIsReflected`: Expected dry-run with explicit version to succeed, got config not found

**Impact**: Build command tests are failing due to config file handling issues in test setup.

**Status**: ❌ **BLOCKING**

---

## Missing Test Files

### Features Marked "done" with Missing Test Files

#### 1. `PROVIDER_BACKEND_INTERFACE`
- **Expected**: `pkg/providers/backend/backend_test.go`
- **Status**: ❌ File does not exist
- **Impact**: Feature marked as done but test file is missing

#### 2. `CLI_DEPLOY`
- **Expected**: `test/e2e/deploy_smoke_test.go`
- **Status**: ❌ File does not exist
- **Impact**: E2E test for deploy command is missing

### Features with Empty Test Arrays (Acceptable)

These are documentation/architecture features that don't require code tests:

- `ARCH_OVERVIEW`: Architecture documentation (no tests expected)
- `DOCS_ADR`: ADR process documentation (no tests expected)

**Status**: ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** (documentation features)

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Issues (Blocking Compliance)

1. **Fix Test Failures** (4 tests)
   - Fix `TestIntrospect_WithSubcommands` and `TestFlagToInfo_BoolFlag` in `internal/tools/cliintrospect`
   - Fix `TestBuildInvalidEnvFails` and `TestBuildExplicitVersionIsReflected` in `internal/cli/commands`
   - **Impact**: Tests must pass for compliance

2. **Improve `pkg/config` Coverage** (66.7% → 80%+)
   - Current coverage: 66.7%
   - Target: 80%
   - Gap: 13.3 percentage points
   - **Impact**: Core package threshold requirement

3. **Add Missing Test Files**
   - Create `pkg/providers/backend/backend_test.go` for `PROVIDER_BACKEND_INTERFACE`
   - Create `test/e2e/deploy_smoke_test.go` for `CLI_DEPLOY`
   - **Impact**: Feature completeness and compliance

### Priority 2: Coverage Improvements

4. **Improve Low Coverage Packages**
   - `internal/git`: 46.9% → target 70%+
   - `internal/tools/docs`: 37.9% → target 60%+
   - `internal/providers/migration/raw`: 33.3% → target 70%+

5. **Maintain High Coverage Packages**
   - Continue maintaining ≥ 80% coverage for core packages
   - Monitor coverage trends in CI

### Priority 3: Process Improvements

6. **Enhance Coverage Script**
   - Consider separate thresholds for `pkg/config` vs `internal/core`
   - Add per-package threshold configuration
   - Improve error messages for threshold violations

7. **Test File Validation**
   - Enhance `validate-spec.sh` to catch missing test files earlier
   - Add pre-commit hook to validate test file existence
   - Consider automated test file generation for new features

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Compliance Unblock (Current Priority)

See `docs/coverage/COVERAGE_COMPLIANCE_PLAN.md` for detailed action plan.

**Immediate Actions** (Required for compliance):
1. Fix 4 failing tests (Phase 1.A)
   - `internal/tools/cliintrospect`: 2 tests
   - `internal/cli/commands`: 2 tests
2. Improve `pkg/config` coverage to 80%+ (Phase 1.B)
   - Add targeted tests for missing paths
3. Add missing test files (Phase 1.C)
   - `pkg/providers/backend/backend_test.go`
   - `test/e2e/deploy_smoke_test.go`

**Agent Brief**: See `docs/agents/AGENT_BRIEF_COVERAGE_PHASE1.md` for ready-to-paste task specification.

### Phase 2: Quality Lift (Non-Blocking)

**Status**: Planned, not yet started  
**Prerequisite**: Phase 1 must be complete

See `docs/coverage/COVERAGE_COMPLIANCE_PLAN_PHASE2.md` and `docs/agents/AGENT_BRIEF_COVERAGE_PHASE2.md` for detailed Phase 2 plan.

**Target Packages:**
- `internal/git` (46.9% → ≥ 70%)
- `internal/tools/docs` (37.9% → ≥ 60%)
- `internal/providers/migration/raw` (33.3% → ≥ 70%)

### Phase 3+: Additional Quality Improvements (Future Work)

**Not part of Phase 1 or Phase 2** - Additional quality improvements:
- Improve coverage in medium-coverage packages (60-79%)
- Add tests for `ExecuteBuild` in `internal/core`
- Enhance test file validation
- Set up coverage trend monitoring
- Automate test file validation in CI
- Regular coverage reviews
