# TODO: Phase 1 – Commit Message Discipline Enforcement

- **Link:** `docs/COMMIT_MESSAGE_ANALYSIS.md`
- **Feature IDs:** `PROVIDER_FRONTEND_GENERIC`, `GOV_V1_CORE`
- **Status:** todo → wip

## Scope

- Wire AI workflows to the mandatory commit rules (hook presence, pattern, FEATURE_ID alignment).
- Ensure single-feature-per-commit rule is documented and exemplified (including multi-feature invalid example).
- Keep `Agent.md` and `COMMIT_MESSAGE_ANALYSIS.md` aligned with actual enforcement behaviour.

## Notes

- Do not change core behaviour in this phase.
- Focus on documentation, hooks, and AI workflow discipline.
