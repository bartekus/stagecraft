4. Locate primary entry points
   - In `docs/generated/ai-agent/REPO_INDEX.md`, read `Where to Start`.
5. Confirm Agent contract and workflow rules
   - Using `docs/generated/ai-agent/DOCS_CATALOG.md`, locate `Root Files` -> `Agent.md` and review `Spec-first, Test-first` and `Feature Planning Protocol`.
6. Survey documentation coverage and structure
   - In `docs/generated/ai-agent/DOCS_CATALOG.md`, read `Summary` and scan `Files by Directory`.
7. Identify governance and process documentation

    - In `docs/generated/ai-agent/SPEC_CATALOG.md`, locate `spec/adr/0001-architecture.md` and review `Core Structure (v1)`.
11. Inspect command and provider patterns
    - From `docs/generated/ai-agent/SPEC_CATALOG.md`, locate `spec/commands/build.md` and `spec/providers/backend/generic.md` and review `CLI Definition` and `Interface`.
