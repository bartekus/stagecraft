# Blog Drafts

This directory contains draft blog posts documenting the Stagecraft development journey.

## Purpose

1. An ADR (Architecture Decision Record) in `docs/adr/`
2. A blog post draft documenting the journey and decisions

## Structure

Blog posts should be named with a number and descriptive title:
- `01-founding-vision.md` - Project vision and goals
- `02-cli-architecture.md` - CLI design decisions
- `03-spec-first-development.md` - Spec-first workflow and features.yaml

## Template

Each blog post should include:

```markdown
# Title
